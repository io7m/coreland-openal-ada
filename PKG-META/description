<p>This package provides a set of Ada bindings to OpenAL.</p>

<p>The package consists of a set of "thin" bindings that are generated from
a set of machine-checked specifications and a set of "thick" bindings that
are hand-written and provide a layer of safety (making it impossible to
misuse the API and preventing many bugs at compile-time).</p>

<p>The package also contains the trivially-parseable specification files used to
generate a large portion of the code. These files are of particular interest to
others writing language bindings (for any language).</p>
