<p>This package provides a set of Ada bindings to OpenAL.</p>
<p>Bindings are generated from a set of machine-checked specifications.</p>
<p>
Lua is required to generate part of the code. It is not a run-time
requirement - the resulting library/code does not depend on Lua in any
way, shape or form.
